    "# Hand labeling review sentences- Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal is to determine how each company's employees feel in the 5 Glassdoor categories (Culture & Values, Work/Life Balance, Senior Management, Comp & Benefits, and Career Opportunities). This is difficult because the PROs and CONs review are written in free-form format, which makes it difficult decipher a priori to discern how an employee feels in the different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "My strategy is to tokenize the text of each review into sentences and study each sentence separately. I will then figure out which categories each sentence speaks to. My thinking is that most sentences speak to just one category, or at the very least, have a similar sentiment about the categories described by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hard part of this strategy is predicting which categories concerns. There are 5 million sentences in the Glassdoor reviews dataset. It would be impossible for me to hand-label all 5 million sentences (at least take about 10,000 hours=5 years of work weeks). Rather, I'll hand-label a subset of the sentences and then later use machine learning to predict the categories of the remaining sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to label 1000 reviews. Being able to label about 400-600 sentences per hour along with the fact that these reviews contained about 4000 sentences total, this was all I could hope to label and still do the rest of my project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will start by labeling the sentences from 1000 PROs reviews. I will also label 1000 sentences from CONs reviews. It should be noted that each PRO and CON review is about 2 sentences on average."
