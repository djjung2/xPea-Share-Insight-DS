    "I will start by working with my collection of 4,000 hand labeled PRO and CON sentences. I will train two Word2Vec models on these sentences, one for PRO and one for CON, and then do some feature engineering, adding binary variables. I will then train 10 Logistic Regression models, one for each category-PRO/CON combination. Then for each PRO sentence, I will apply the 5 PRO models to the sentence, predicting if the sentence belongs to each category. I will also do the same for the CON sentences, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Transforming and predicting labels of all reviews </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I'll work with the collection of Glassdoor reviews. After some filtering, I'll end up analyzing a collection of ~1.2 million Glassdoor reviews and ~5 million sentences. I'll apply the previously trained Word2Vec models to each of the Glassdoor sentences and do the same feature engineering. I'll then apply the already trained Logistic Regression models to all of the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Find companies' average sentiments </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll conclude by performing VADER sentiment analysis on each sentence, and then find the average sentiment scores grouped by company.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last note, I think precision matters more than recall, i.e. having a lot of false negatives is worse than having a lot of false positives. I want each of the reviews in each category to represent how that company behaves in that category. If I miss a few reviews for a category, that's better than having flawed reviews being counted. Still, I desire high precision and recall if possible."
