# xPea

I created xPea, a job recommendation system that suggests jobs tailored to each user's preferred balance between good company experience and job title. A user inputs a job title at a publicly traded company, and xPea will compare 13,000 unique job titles at over 4,000 companies to suggest similar jobs at companies. I deployed this project as a Flask web app hosted on AWS at xpeashare.work . This project was created as a Fellow in 4 weeks during the Fall 2018 session of Insight Data Science.
