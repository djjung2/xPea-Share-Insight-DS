        Hello! 
        I recently finished my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I studied analysis and geometry.
        For my research, I was essentially interested in the best way to steer a car pulling multiple trailers while minimizing gas usage and, you know, obeying laws of physics.

        I completed this project <b>xPea</b> in 3 weeks as a part of the Fall 2018 session of Insight Data Science in New York City.
        It was an exciting project to create and develop from end-to-end.
        I would be happy to talk with you more about my project or anything else.
        I live in Long Island City and am currently looking for a job in the New York City area.

      <h4> 
        For reading this far, I'll tell you a few <del>lame</del> hilarious jokes/stories I've come up with (I  expect that no one besides me will ever see this).
      </h4>

      <p>
        <b>1.</b> 
        A physicist, a mathematician, and a statistician are sitting on a train.  The physicist is playing with a rubber band, the mathematician is eating dinner, and the statistician is reading a newspaper.  Who is the conductor? <br> <br> Not the rubber band... because rubber isn't a conductor!

        <b>2.</b>
        There once was a French political party called Lagrange's Multipliers, which was a group of ardent supporters of the operation of multiplication.  It disbanded quickly however, due to some ... division in the party.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p> 
        <b>3.</b>
        A man is holding pickles in his hands and wants to store them somewhere.  He spies an empty room and hopes that there are containers inside.  He enters the room, but doesn't see any.  Then he turns around and notices that the door is ajar.
      </p>

        <b>4.</b>
        A dinosaur is at a fancy steakhouse.  The waiter dinosaur comes up to him and says, "Sir, what will you have?"  And the dinosaur is like, "I'll take a half pound steak."  And the waiter dinosaur is like, "Ok that sounds good."  And then the dinosaur is like, "Actually give me a little more meat. 1 pound."  And the waiter dinosaur is like, "ok sir."  And then the dinosaur is like actually I want meatier.  2 pounds."  And the waiter dinosaur is like, "um ok sir."  And then the dinosaur is like, "Meatier. 3 pounds."  And the waiter says, "Meatier. Meatier."  And the dinosaur is like, "um sure..."  And the waiter is like, "Meatier. Meatier."  And the dinosaur is like, "Hey buddy, are you making fun of me?"  And then the waiter is like, "Meatier.  Meatier.  Meteor."  The end.

        Did you know that people sell plastic nets to hit tennis balls with?

        <br>

        I just think it's a racket.

        OR

        Did you know that people sell plastic nets to hit tennis balls with, making a lot of noise?

        <br>

        I just think it's a racket.

        (3 definitions of racket...)

        Did you hear, downtown, there's a marketplace selling homemade crafts?

        <br><br> 

        I just think it's a little bazaar.

        <i>Oh dear, John</i>, by Nicholas Sparks 
        <br> <br>

        In the best seller <i>Dear John</i>, we journeyed with Savannah as she fell in love with a soldier John and experienced the death of her husband Tom. Now married to John with kids, Savannah must overcome yet another challenge: Dealing with John's lame jokes.

        <br><br>

        John: Hey Savannah Banana. Guess what?<br>
        Savannah: What John?<br>
        John: Why did the soldier no longer see one-to-one with his pompous, recently promoted general?<br>
        Savannah: Why John?...<br>
        John: Because he no longer had a trivial colonel.<br>
        Savannah: Oh dear, John.
      </p>
